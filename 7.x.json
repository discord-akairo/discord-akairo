\n","path":"docs/general/welcome.md"}}},"basics":{"name":"Basics","files":{"setup":{"name":"Setting Up","type":"md","content":"# Setting Up\n\n### Installation\n\nBefore even doing anything else, you of course have to install the Discord.js and Akairo.  \n\n`npm install discord.js`  \n`npm install discord-akairo`  \n\nIf you feel like working with SQLite or Sequelize later, install that too.  \n\n`npm install sqlite`  \n`npm install sequelize`  \n\nOnce everything has been installed, your working directory should look something like this:  \n\n```\nmybot\n|____ node_modules\n      bot.js\n```\n\n### Main File\n\nInside `bot.js`, require `discord-akairo` and create your client:  \n\n```js\nconst { AkairoClient } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nconst client = new AkairoClient();\n\nclient.login('TOKEN');\n```\n\nThere are some options that you may want to use with your client.  \nLet's setup the owner, the prefix for commands, and the directory for commands.  \nIf you would like to have multiple owners or multiple prefixes, simply add those with an array.  \nWe want to use Discord.js's `disableEveryone` option too.  \n\n```js\nconst { AkairoClient } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nconst client = new AkairoClient({\n    ownerID: '123992700587343872', // or ['123992700587343872', '86890631690977280']\n    prefix: '?', // or ['?', '!']\n    commandDirectory: './commands/'\n}, {\n    disableEveryone: true\n});\n\nclient.login('TOKEN');\n```\n\nNow, your folder should look like this:  \n\n```\nmybot\n|____ node_modules\n|____ commands\n      bot.js\n```\n\nYour bot should now login, and you are ready to make commands.  \n","path":"docs/basics/setup.md"},"commands":{"name":"Basic Commands","type":"md","content":"# Basic Commands\n\n### Ping Command\n\nOur first order of business is to make a ping command.  \nNo bot is complete without one!  \n\nIn the last tutorial, we specified that the `commandDirectory` is in `./commands/`.  \nSo, go there, make a new file, and require Akairo.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n```\n\nThere are two ways to make modules in Akairo.  \nBoth are equally valid, so choose whichever you like.  \n\n```js\n// As an instance.\n// Pro: Shorter code.\n// Con: Relies on using the `function`\n// keyword for the context of `this`.\nmodule.exports = new Command(...);\n\n// As a class.\n// Pro: Does not rely on `function`,\n// and also more easily extendable.\n// Con: Longer code.\nclass PingCommand extends Command { ... }\nmodule.exports = PingCommand;\n```\n\nIn other tutorials, we will be using the second method, as it is less confusing for use.  \nHere is a basic ping command:  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass PingCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('ping', {\n           aliases: ['ping'] \n        });\n    }\n    \n    exec(message) {\n        return message.reply('Pong!');\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = PingCommand;\n```\n\nThe first parameter is the unique ID of the command.  \nIt is not seen nor used by users, but you should keep it the same as one of the aliases.  \n\nThe second parameter is the options.  \nThe only option there right now are the aliases, which are the names of the command for the users to call.  \n\nThe exec method is the execution function, ran when the command is called.  \nYou should try to always return a value such as a Promise with it, so that the framework can tell when a command finishes.  \n\nUsing the instance method, the above would look like so:  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nfunction exec(message) {\n    return message.reply('Pong!');\n}\n\nmodule.exports = new Command('ping', exec, {\n    aliases: ['ping']\n});\n```\n\nIf everything was done correctly, your command should now work!  \nBecause there are a lot of things that can be changed for commands, they will be explained further in other tutorials.  \n","path":"docs/basics/commands.md"},"inhibitors":{"name":"Basic Inhibitors","type":"md","content":"# Basic Inhibitors\n\n### Setup\n\nInhibitors are a way to monitor or block messages coming into the command handler.  \nBecause inhibitors are another kind of module, we need another kind of handler.  \nTo set it up, simply add the `inhibitorDirectory` option to your client.  \n\n```js\nconst { AkairoClient } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nconst client = new AkairoClient({\n    ownerID: '123992700587343872',\n    prefix: '?',\n    commandDirectory: './commands/',\n    inhibitorDirectory: './inhibitors/'\n}, {\n    disableEveryone: true\n});\n\nclient.login('TOKEN');\n```\n\n### Blacklist\n\nCreate a folder named `inhibitors`, then a file there to make one.  \nJust like with commands, both an instance export and a class export works.  \nBut we will keep to an instance export because they are shorter.  \n\n```js\nconst { Inhibitor } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass BlacklistInhibitor extends Inhibitor {\n    constructor() {\n        super('blacklist', {\n            reason: 'blacklist'\n        })\n    }\n\n    exec(message) {\n        // He's a meanie!\n        const blacklist = ['81440962496172032'];\n        return blacklist.includes(message.author.id);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = BlacklistInhibitor;\n```\n\nThe first parameter is the unique ID of the inhibitor.  \n\nThe second parameter are the options.  \nThe option `reason` is what will get emitted to an event, but we can worry about that later.  \n\nThe exec method should return either `true`, a promise rejection, or a falsey value.  \nIf it is not a falsey value, that means the message has been blocked!  \n","path":"docs/basics/inhibitors.md"},"listeners":{"name":"Basic Listeners","type":"md","content":"# Basic Listeners\n\n### I'm Ready!\n\nListeners are a basic concept in Node.js.  \nProblem is, you usually end up with loooooong files attaching listeners on your client.  \nAnd plus, you can't reload them as easily!  \n\nLet's add some listeners.  \nYou have to setup a `listenerDirectory` just like with commands and inhibitors.  \n\n```js\nconst { AkairoClient } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nconst client = new AkairoClient({\n    ownerID: '123992700587343872',\n    prefix: '?',\n    commandDirectory: './commands/',\n    inhibitorDirectory: './inhibitors/',\n    listenerDirectory: './listeners/'\n}, {\n    disableEveryone: true\n});\n\nclient.login('TOKEN');\n```\n\nAnd now, we can make some!  \nLet's start with a simple client `ready` event.  \n\n```js\nconst { Listener } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass ReadyListener extends Listener {\n    constructor() {\n        super('ready', {\n            emitter: 'client',\n            eventName: 'ready'\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec() {\n        console.log('I\\'m ready!');\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = ReadyListener;\n```\n\nThe first parameter is the listener's unique ID.  \n\nThe second parameter are the options.  \nFirst, we have the emitter's name.  \nThen, we have the event we want to listen to.  \n\nThen there is its execution function, whose parameters are the event's.  \n\nHere are the emitters that exist by default:  \n\n- `client`\n- `commandHandler`\n- `inhibitorHandler`\n- `listenerHandler`\n\n### Blocked Commands\n\nRemember the `reason` for inhibitors in previous tutorial?  \nThey are emitted to the `messageBlocked` (anything with `pre` type or before) or `commandBlocked` (everything after) event.  \n\nHere's how you would listen to them:  \n\n```js\nconst { Listener } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass CommandBlockedListener extends Listener {\n    constructor() {\n        super('commandBlocked', {\n            emitter: 'commandHandler',\n            eventName: 'commandBlocked'\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, command, reason) {\n        console.log(`${message.author.username} was blocked from using ${command.id} because of ${reason}!`);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = CommandBlockedListener;\n```\n\nAnd if you want your listeners to run only once:  \n\n```js\nconst { Listener } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass CommandBlockedListener extends Listener {\n    constructor() {\n        super('commandBlocked', {\n            emitter: 'commandHandler',\n            eventName: 'commandBlocked',\n            type: 'once'\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, command, reason) {\n        console.log(`${message.author.username} was blocked from using ${command.id} because of ${reason}!`);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = CommandBlockedListener;\n```\n","path":"docs/basics/listeners.md"}}},"commands":{"name":"Commands","files":{"restrictions":{"name":"Restrictions","type":"md","content":"# Restrictions\n\n### Channel Restrictions\n\nIf a command requires a guild to be used correctly, you can restrict it to a guild with one option.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass NicknameCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('nickname', {\n            aliases: ['nickname']\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message) {\n        return message.reply(`Your nickname is ${message.member.nickname}.`);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = NicknameCommand;\n```\n\nThe above breaks in a DM, so let's add the `channelRestriction` option.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass NicknameCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('nickname', {\n            aliases: ['nickname'],\n            channelRestriction: 'guild'\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message) {\n        return message.reply(`Your nickname is ${message.member.nickname}.`);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = NicknameCommand;\n```\n\nEverything is fixed and you can go on your way!  \nAs a bonus, this will emit `commandBlocked` on the command handler with the reason `guild` if someone tries to use it in a DM.  \n\n### Owner Only\n\nRemember the `ownerID` option in your client?  \nYour commands can be owner-only, restricting them to be used by the owner(s).  \nSimply add `ownerOnly`.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass TokenCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('token', {\n            aliases: ['token'],\n            ownerOnly: true,\n            channelRestriction: 'dm'\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message) {\n        // Don't actually do this.\n        return message.reply(this.client.token);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = TokenCommand;\n```\n\nThis will emit `commandBlocked` with the reason `owner` if someone else uses it.  \n","path":"docs/commands/restrictions.md"},"permissions":{"name":"Permissions","type":"md","content":"# Permissions\n\n### Permission Flags\n\nSome commands should only be used by someone with certain permissions.  \nThere are options to help you do this.  \nThe two options to use are `clientPermissions` and `userPermissions`.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass BanCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('ban', {\n            aliases: ['ban'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'member',\n                    type: 'member'\n                }\n            ],\n            clientPermissions: ['BAN_MEMBERS'],\n            userPermissions: ['BAN_MEMBERS'],\n            channelRestriction: 'guild'\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        if (!args.member) {\n            return message.reply('No member found with that name.');    \n        }\n\n        return args.member.ban().then(() => {\n            return message.reply(`${args.member} was banned!`);\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = BanCommand;\n```\n\nThis now checks for the required permissions for the client, then the user.  \nJust like `channelRestriction`, it emits `commandBlocked` on the command handler.  \nThe reason is either `clientPermissions` or `userPermissions`.  \n\n### Dynamic Permissions\n\nSometimes, you may want to check for a role instead of permission flags.  \nThis means you can use a function instead of an array!  \nA function can be used on both `clientPermissions` and `userPermissions`.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass BanCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('ban', {\n            aliases: ['ban'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'member',\n                    type: 'member'\n                }\n            ],\n            clientPermissions: ['BAN_MEMBERS'],\n            channelRestriction: 'guild'\n        });\n    }\n    \n    userPermissions(message) {\n        return message.member.roles.exists(role => role.name === 'Moderator');\n    }\n    \n    exec(message, args) {\n        if (!args.member) {\n            return message.reply('No member found with that name.');    \n        }\n\n        return args.member.ban().then(() => {\n            return message.reply(`${args.member} was banned!`);\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = BanCommand;\n```\n","path":"docs/commands/permissions.md"},"cooldowns":{"name":"Cooldowns","type":"md","content":"# Cooldowns\n\n### No Spam!\n\nCooldowns are how you make sure that troublemakers don't spam your bot.  \nAkairo allows you to set cooldowns in uses per milliseconds.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\nconst exampleAPI = require('example-api');\n\nclass RequestCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('request', {\n            aliases: ['request'],\n            cooldown: 10000,\n            ratelimit: 2\n        });\n    }\n\n

amount of time a user would be in cooldown for.  \n`ratelimit` is the amount of uses a user can do before they are denied usage.  \n\nIn simple terms, this means 2 uses every 10000 milliseconds.  \n\nIf you wish to set a default cooldown for all commands, the `defaultCooldown` option is available:  \n\n```js\nconst { AkairoClient } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nconst client = new AkairoClient({\n    ownerID: '123992700587343872',\n    prefix: '?',\n    defaultCooldown: 1000,\n    commandDirectory: './commands/',\n    inhibitorDirectory: './inhibitors/',\n    listenerDirectory: './listeners/'\n}, {\n    disableEveryone: true\n});\n\nclient.login('TOKEN');\n```\n\nWhen someone uses a command while in cooldown, the event `commandCooldown` will be emitted on the command handler with the remaining time in milliseconds.  \n","path":"docs/commands/cooldowns.md"},"regex":{"name":"Regex Commands","type":"md","content":"# Regex Commands\n\n### Memes\n\nRegex or regular expressions, is basically a way to match characters in a string.  \nCommands can be triggered with regular expressions using the `trigger` option.  \nMultiple regex commands/conditional can be triggered from one message.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass AyyCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('ayy', {\n            trigger:

with the content `ayy`, case-insensitive.  \nThe `match` parameter will be the result from `message.content.match(/^ayy$/i)`.  \nThe `groups` parameter will be the matched groups, if using a global regex.  \n\n### As a Function\n\nThe `trigger` option can also be a function.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass AyyCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('ayy', {\n            category: 'random'\n        });\n    }\n\n    trigger(message) {\n        // Do some code...\n        return /^ayy$/i;\n    }\n\n    exec(message, match, groups) {\n

Commands\n\n### if (commandIs('conditional', message))\n\nConditional commands are commands that run if a certain criteria is matched on a message.  \nThis is done with the `condition` option, which must be a function.  \nMultiple conditional commands/regex commands can be triggered on one message.    \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass ComplimentCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('compliment', {\n            category: 'random'\n        });\n    }\n\n    condition(message) {\n        return message.author.id === '126485019500871680';\n    }\n\n    exec(message) {\n        return message.reply('You are a great person!');\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = ComplimentCommand;\n```\n","path":"docs/commands/conditional.md"},"prefixes":{"name":"Prefixes and Aliases","type":"md","content":"# Prefixes\n\n### Mentioning\n\nSometimes people can forget or not know the prefix for your bot, so letting them use command with a mention is useful.  \nThis can be enabled with the `allowMention` property.  \n\n```js\nconst { AkairoClient } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nconst client = new AkairoClient({\n    ownerID: '123992700587343872',\n    prefix: '?',\n    allowMention: true,\n    commandDirectory: './commands/',\n

Prefix Overrides\n\nPrefix overrides are command-specific prefixes.  \nTo use them, simply add the `prefix` option.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass SecretCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('secret', {\n            aliases: ['secret'],\n            prefix: '???'\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message) {\n        return message.reply('Woah! How did you find this!?');\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = SecretCommand;\n```\n\nNow, if our prefix was `?`, `?secret` won't work, but `???secret` would.  \n\nAn array works too, so you can do `prefix: ['???', '??']` and both would work.  \nLonger prefixes should be first in the list.  \nIf it was the other way around, (`['??', '???']`), `??` would be found first and `???secret` would be parsed as `??` and `?secret` instead.  \n","path":"docs/commands/prefixes.md"},"commandutil":{"name":"CommandUtil","type":"md","content":"# CommandUtil\n\n### Handling Edits\n\nThe CommandUtil class is a utility class for working with responses.  \nIn order to make it available, you must enable either `handleEdits` or `commandUtil`.  \nBecause they can use a bit of memory if there are many messages, `commandUtilLifetime` should be set.  \n\n```js\nconst { AkairoClient } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nconst client = new AkairoClient({\n    ownerID: '123992700587343872',\n    prefix: '?',\n

{\n    disableEveryone: true\n});\n\nclient.login('TOKEN');\n```\n\nNow, CommandUtil is available on messages with the property `util`.  \nYou can CommandUtil methods such as `send` in order to send responses.  \nWith `handleEdits` on, the `send` methods will edits responses accordingly.  \nThis works for prompts as well.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass HelloCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('hello', {\n            aliases: ['hello']\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message) {\n        // Also available: util.reply()\n        return message.util.send('Hello!');\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = HelloCommand;\n```\n\nAs an example of what that means:  \n\n- User sends `?ping` (message A).\n- Bot replies with `Pong!` (message B).\n- User edits message A to `?hello`.\n- Bot edits message B to `Hello!`.\n\n### Prefix and Alias\n\nCommandUtil can also be used to view the prefix and alias used.  \nThe format for command is almost always `<prefix><alias> <arguments>`.  \nSince you have the arguments for parsing already, CommandUtil stores the first two for you.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass HelloCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('hello', {\n            aliases: ['hello', 'hi', 'konnichiha', 'bonjour', 'heyo']\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message) {\n        if (message.util.alias === 'konnichiha') {\n            return message.util.send('こんにちは！');\n        }\n\n        if (message.util.alias === 'bonjour') {\n            return message.util.send('Bonjour!');\n        }\n\n        return message.util.send('Hello!');\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = HelloCommand;\n```\n\nWith that, you can see which alias was used by the user.  \n\nYou can see the prefix as well.  \nFor example, if you have two prefixes, `?` and `!`, `message.util.prefix` will be either `?` or `!`.  \n\nCommandUtil, if enabled, is available on all messages just after built-in pre-inhibitors.  \nThis means an invalid input, e.g. `?not-a-command` will still be parsed with prefix of `?` and alias of `not-a-command`.

should also have some user input, in the form of arguments.  \nIn Akairo, arguments are the most complex things ever, so this tutorial will only go through the basics.  \n\nLet's make a command that takes three numbers and adds them up.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass AddCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('add', {\n            aliases: ['add']\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message) {\n        // This doesn't work!\n        return message.reply(a + b + c);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = AddCommand;\n```\n\nNow we will add arguments in the command options with the `args` option.  \nThis option must be an array of objects, containing info for parsing.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass AddCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('add', {\n            aliases: ['add'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'numOne',\n                    type: 'number',\n                    default: 0\n                },\n                {\n                    id: 'numTwo',\n                    type: 'number',\n                    default: 0\n                }\n                {\n                    id: 'numThree',\n                    type: 'number',\n                    default: 0\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        const sum = args.numOne + args.numTwo + args.numThree;\n        return message.reply(`The sum is ${sum}!`);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = AddCommand;\n```\n\nArguments must always have an `id`, it will be what you use to refer to them in `args`.  \nThe `type` options is optional, but since we want numbers, it is set to `number`.  \nThe `default` is what is used if there are no input or no number input.  \n\n### Argument Splitting\n\nA popular feature for bots are quoted arguments.  \nBy default, arguments are not quoted, but changing it is easy.  \nLet's make a command that asks for the name, location, and age.   \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass InfoCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('info', {\n            aliases: ['info'],\n            split: 'quoted',\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'name'\n                },\n                {\n                    id: 'location'\n                }\n                {\n                    id: 'age',\n                    type: 'number'\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        return message.reply(`Hi ${args.age} years old ${args.name} from ${args.location}!`);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = InfoCommand;\n```\n\nThe `split` option determines how arguments are split into words.  \nSo now, we can input `?info \"John Smith\" \"Somewhere, Earth\" 25` and our result will be `Hi 25 years old John Smith from Somewhere, Earth!`.  \n\nOther `split` types are:  \n\n- `plain` (default) splits by whitespace, and whitespace only.\n- `split` splits the noob way, using `message.content.split(' ')` and should never be used.\n- `quoted` splits by whitespace and double quotes.\n- `sticky` splits by whitespace and double quotes, but with some minor changes.\n- `none` does not split at all, giving the entire content as one word.\n\nThe difference between `quoted` and `sticky` is this:  \nLet's take the input `!command 123\"hello world\" 456`.  \n\n- `quoted` will parse this as `['123', 'hello world', '456']`.  \n- `sticky` will parse this as `['123\"hello world\"', '456']`.  \n\nThis may seem weird, but you will see the reason later.  \n","path":"docs/arguments/arguments.md"},"matches":{"name":"Matching Input","type":"md","content":"# Matching Input\n\n### Entire Content\n\nLet's say you have a command that picks from a list inputted.  \nObviously, you won't know how many things there are.  \nSo, we need a different way of matching input instead of word by word.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass PickCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('pick', {\n            aliases: ['pick'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    // Only takes one word!\n                    id: 'items'\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        const picked = args.items; // ???\n        return message.reply(`I picked ${picked}`);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = PickCommand;\n```\n\nTo remedy this, we will use the `match` option.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass PickCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('pick', {\n            aliases: ['pick'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'items',\n                    match: 'content'\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        const items = args.items.split('|');\n        const picked = items[Math.floor(Math.random() * items.length)]\n        return message.reply(`I picked ${picked.trim()}!`);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = PickCommand;\n```\n\nNow, the entire content, excluding the prefix and command of course, is matched. \n\n### Flags\n\nIf you had a command with lots of argument that can be true or false, you may forget the order.  \nThis is where `flag` match comes in handy.  \n\nHere is a command where the user can change the output with a flag:  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\nconst exampleAPI = require('example-api');\n\nclass StatsCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('stats', {\n            aliases: ['stats'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'username'\n                },\n                {\n                    id: 'advanced',\n                    match: 'flag',\n                    prefix: '--advanced'\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        const user = exampleAPI.getUser(args.username);\n\n        if (args.advanced) {\n            return message.reply(user.advancedInfo);\n        }\n\n        return message.reply(user.basicInfo);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = StatsCommand;\n```\n\nNow, if a user does `?stats 1Computer` they will get the `basicInfo`, but if they do `?stats 1Computer --advanced`, they will get the `advancedInfo`.  \nIt can be out of order too, so `?stats --advanced 1Computer` will work.  \n\n### Prefix\n\nThe above example shows `flag`, which does only a boolean value, there or not there.  \nHere, we will use `prefix` for unordered input.  \n\nSimilar to the above example, but this time, we have many different possibilities.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\nconst exampleAPI = require('example-api');\n\nclass StatsCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('stats', {\n            aliases: ['stats'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'username'\n                },\n                {\n                    id: 'color',\n                    match: 'prefix',\n                    prefix: '--color=',\n                    default: 'red'\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        const team = exampleAPI.getTeam(args.color);\n        const user = team.getUser(args.username);\n        \n        return message.reply(user.info);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = StatsCommand;\n```\n\nSo now, all of these inputs can be valid:  \n\n- `?stats 1Computer`\n- `?stats 1Computer --color=blue`\n- `?stats --color=green 1Computer`\n\nIf you would like to use multiple flags or prefixes, you can use an array.  \nSo, if you did `prefix: ['--color=', '--colour=']`, both will be valid for the user.  \n\n### Quoted and Sticky\n\nRemember `quoted` and `sticky`?  \nThis is where the difference is important.  \n\nWith the input `?stats 1Computer --color=\"light blue\"`:  \n\n- `quoted` gives us `{ username: '1Computer', color: '\"light' }`.\n- `sticky` gives us `{ username: '1Computer', color: 'light blue' }`.\n\nUse the one that fits for what you are doing!  \n\n### Other Match Types\n\nHere are some other match types that may be useful.  \n\n- `word` (default) matches word by word.\n- `rest` matches the rest of the content, minus things matched by `prefix` and `flag`.\n- `flag` matches a flag.\n- `prefix` matches a flag with additional input.\n- `content` matches the content.\n- `text` matches the content, minus things matched by `prefix` and `flag`.\n- `none` matches nothing at all.\n","path":"docs/arguments/matches.md"},"types":{"name":"Argument Types","type":"md","content":"# Argument Types\n\n### Basic Types\n\nAs seen in the previous tutorials, there was the `type` option for type casting.  \nYou've only seen the type `number`, so here are the rest of them:  \n\n- `string` (default)\n    - This type does not do anything.\n    - Fails if there was no input.\n- `lowercase`\n    - Transform input to all lowercase.\n    - Fails if there was no input.\n- `uppercase`\n    - Transform input to all uppercase.\n    - Fails if there was no input.\n- `charCodes`\n    - Transform the input to an array of char codes.\n    - Fails if there was no input.\n- `number`\n    - Casts to a number.\n    - Fails if input is not a number.\n- `integer`\n    - Casts to a integer.\n    - Fails if input is not a number.\n- `dynamic`\n    - Casts to a number.\n    - If not a number, does the same as `string`.\n- `dynamicInt`\n    - Casts to a integer.\n    - If not a number, does the same as `string`.\n- `url`\n    - Parses to an URL object.\n    - Fails if not a valid URL.\n- `date`\n    - Parses to a Date object.\n    - Fails if not a valid date.\n- `color`\n    - Parses a hex code to an color integer.\n    - Fails if invalid color.\n- `commandAlias`\n    - Finds a command by alias.\n    - Fails if alias does not exist.\n- `command`\n    - Finds a command by ID.\n    - Fails if no command with that ID.\n- `inhibitor`\n    - Finds an inhibitor by ID.\n    - Fails if no inhibitor with that ID.\n- `listener`\n    - Finds a listener by ID.\n    - Fails if no listener with that ID.\n\n### Discord Types\n\nOf course, since this is a framework for Discord.js, there are Discord-related types.  \n\n- `user`\n    - Resolves a user from the client's collection.\n    - Fails if it cannot find one.\n- `member`\n    - Resolves a member from the guild's collection.\n    - Fails if it cannot find one.\n- `relevant`\n    - Resolves a user from the relevant place.\n    - Works in both guilds and DMs.\n    - Fails if it cannot find one.\n- `channel`\n    - Resolves a channel from the guild's collection.\n    - Fails if it cannot find one.\n- `textChannel`\n    - Resolves a text channel from the guild's collection.\n    - Fails if it cannot find one.\n- `voiceChannel`\n    - Resolves a voice channel from the guild's collection.\n    - Fails if it cannot find one.\n- `role`\n    - Resolves a role from the guild's collection.\n    - Fails if it cannot find one.\n- `emoji`\n    - Resolves an emoji from the guild's collection.\n    - Fails if it cannot find one.\n- `guild`\n    - Resolves a guild from the client's collection.\n    - Fails if it cannot find one.\n\nAll of the above types also have plural forms.  \nSo if you do `users` instead of `user`, you will receive a Collection of resolved users.  \nThe types below are also Discord-related, but have no plural form.  \n\n- `message`\n    - Fetches a message from an ID.\n    - Fails if the fetching errored or message was not found.\n- `invite`\n    - Resolves an invite code from a link.\n    - Fails if no code could be resolved.\n- `memberMention`\n    - Matches the member from a mention.\n    - Fails if there are no members with the mention's ID.\n- `channelMention`\n    - Matches the channel from a mention.\n    - Fails if there are no channels with the mention's ID.\n- `roleMention`\n    - Matches the role from a mention.\n    - Fails if there are no roles with the mention's ID.\n- `emojiMention`\n    - Matches the emoji from a mention.\n    - Fails if there are no emojis with the mention's ID.\n    \n### Array Types\n\nThere are other ways to do type-casting instead of a string literal too.  \nThe first way is with an array:  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass PokemonCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('pokemon', {\n            aliases: ['pokemon'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'option',\n                    type: ['grass', 'fire', 'water', 'electric'],\n                    default: 'electric'\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        if (args.option === 'grass') return message.reply('bulbasaur');\n        if (args.option === 'fire') return message.reply('charmander');\n        if (args.option === 'water') return message.reply('squirtle');\n        if (args.option === 'electric') return message.reply('pikachu');\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = PokemonCommand;\n```\n\nWith the above, the user can only enter one of the entries in the array.  \nIt is also case-insensitive for input, but not for output.  \nThis means that if the array was `['GrasS', 'FIrE']` and the input was `grass`, you will get `GrasS`.  \n\nYou can also do aliases with the array type like so:  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass PokemonCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('pokemon', {\n            aliases: ['pokemon'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'option',\n                    type: [\n                        ['grass', 'leaf', 'green'],\n                        ['fire', 'red'],\n                        ['water', 'blue'],\n                        ['electric', 'electricity', 'lightning', 'yellow']\n                    ],\n                    default: 'electric'\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        if (args.option === 'grass') return message.reply('bulbasaur');\n        if (args.option === 'fire') return message.reply('charmander');\n        if (args.option === 'water') return message.reply('squirtle');\n        if (args.option === 'electric') return message.reply('pikachu');\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = PokemonCommand;\n```\n\nIf the user inputs anything from the arrays, the first entry will be used.  \nSo, the input of `leaf` will give you `grass`, `blue` will give you `water`, etc.  \n\n### Regex Types\n\nYou can also use a regular expression as a type.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass AskCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('ask', {\n            aliases: ['ask'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'yesOrNo',\n                    type: /^(yes|no)$/i\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        // {\n        //   match: [...],\n        //   groups: null\n        // }\n        console.log(args.yesOrNo);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = AskCommand;\n```\n\nThis will match `yes` or `no`, case-insensitive and `args.yesOrNo` will give you the result from `word.match(/^(yes|no)$/i`.  \nIf using a global regex, the `groups` property will be filled for matched groups.   \n","path":"docs/arguments/types.md"},"functions":{"name":"Using Functions","type":"md","content":"# Using Functions\n\n### Dynamic Defaults\n\nWhen you are doing default values for certain arguments, you could really only do what JavaScript has to offer: numbers, strings, etc.  \nWhat if we want to use a default such as the author's username or the guild's owner?  \nThis is where you can use a function.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass HighestRoleCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('highestRole', {\n            aliases: ['highestRole'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'member',\n                    type: 'member',\n                    default: message => message.member\n                }\n            ],\n            channelRestriction: 'guild'\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        return message.reply(args.member.highestRole.name);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = HighestRoleCommand;\n```\n\nThe command above gives the name of the inputted member's highest role.  \nIf there were no member or an incorrect member provided, the `default` function is called, giving us the message member.  \n\n### Dynamic Types\n\nLet's go to using a function for types.  \nTake a look at the roll command below.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass RollCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('roll', {\n            aliases: ['roll'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'amount',\n                    type: 'integer',\n                    default: 100\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        const res = Math.floor(Math.random() * args.amount));\n        return message.reply(`You rolled ${res}!`);\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = RollCommand;\n```\n\nLet's say we want to limit the user to between 1-100, so that there are no giant numbers.  \nWhile we could do it in the execution function, let's stick it straight into the type as a function.  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass RollCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('roll', {\n            aliases: ['roll'],\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'amount',\n                    type: word => {\n                        if (!word || isNaN(word)) return null;\n                        const num = parseInt(word);\n                        if (num < 1 || num > 100) return null;\n                        return num;\n                    },\n                    default: 100\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        const res = Math.floor(Math.random() * args.amount));\n        return

 \nSimply do `type: 'pokemon'` for an argument and everything will work as expected.  \n\n### With Message\n\nLet's say we want to add a type that would get a role based on the input.  \nThis means we need access to the guild through the message.  \nGood thing the second parameter is the message!  \n\n```js\nclient.commandHandler.resolver.addType('colorRole', (word, message) => {\n    if (!word) return null;\n\n    const roles = {\n        red: '225939226628194304',\n        blue: '225939219841810432',\n        green: '225939232512802816'\n    };\n\n    const role = message.guild.roles.get(roles[word.toLowerCase()]);\n    return role || null;\n});\n```\n\nSo now, using the type `colorRole`, we can get either red, blue, or green from the input and end up with corresponding role object!  \n\n### Accessing Another Type\n\nTo get another type for use, you use the `type` method on TypeResolver.  \nThe following gives the `member` type and we can use as part of another type.  \n\n```js\nclient.commandHandler.resolver.addType('moderator', (word, message) => {\n    if (!word) return null;\n    const memberType = client.commandHandler.resolver.type('member');\n    const member = memberType(word, message);\n    if (!member.roles.has('222089067028807682')) return null;\n    return member;\n});\n```\n","path":"docs/arguments/custom.md"},"prompts":{"name":"Argument Prompting","type":"md","content":"# Argument Prompting\n\n### Please Try Again\n\nYou may notice prompting for arguments in other bots (Tatsumaki) or bot frameworks (Commando).  \nAkairo has a flexible way for you to do them too!

`load` method.  \n\nWith `add`, the handler will scan the specificed directory for it and look for a file with the name.  \nFor example, if you had `commands/ping.js`, you can load it by doing `<CommandHandler>.add('ping')`.  \n\nWith `load`, you will need to specify a full filepath or a module instance/class.  \nIf you load with an object, note that those cannot be reloaded.

require('./CustomModule');\n\nclass CustomHandler extends AkairoHandler {\n    constructor(client, options) {\n        super(client, options.customDirectory, CustomModule);\n\n

`super()` takes the client, the directory for the handler, and the class of the module type we want to handle.  \n\nBefore we can add this handler to our client, we have to extend AkairoClient, because that's good practice.  \nWe want to override the `build()` method, because that is where the handlers get built.  \n\n```js\nconst { AkairoClient } = require('discord-akairo');\nconst

so, we create our handler.  \nThen we call the super method, because that builds the default handlers.  \nYou can put the super call first if you need it in another order.  \n\nNow, although the handler is built, we do not have the modules loaded.  \nThe `loadAll()` method has to be overridden now.  \n\n```js\nconst { AkairoClient } = require('discord-akairo');\nconst CustomHandler =

SequelizeProvider, optional utility classes for databases.  \nNote that if you are doing something complicated with databases, you should use SQLite or Sequelize directly.  \n\nLet's implement per-guild prefixes.  \nFirst, create a new SQLiteProvider or SequelizeProvider.  \n\n```js\nconst sqlite = require('sqlite');\nconst sequelize = require('sequelize');\n\nconst { AkairoClient, SQLiteProvider, SequelizeProvider } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass CustomClient extends AkairoClient {\n    constructor() {\n        super({\n            /* Options here */\n        });\n\n        // With SQLite\n        this.settings = new SQLiteProvider(sqlite.open('path/to/db.sqlite'), 'table_name', {\n            idColumn: 'guild_id',\n            dataColumn: 'settings'\n        });\n\n        // Or, with sequelize\n        this.settings = new SequelizeProvider(/* Sequelize model here */, {\n            idColumn: 'guild_id',\n            dataColumn: 'settings'\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe providers only handle one table at a time.  \nNotice that you can set the `idColumn` and the `dataColumn`.  \n\nThe `idColumn` defaults to `id` and is the unique key for that table.  \nThe `dataColumn` is optional and will change the behavior of the provider in relation with the database.  \n\nWhen the `dataColumn` is provided, the provider will parse a single column as JSON in order to set values.  \nFor Sequelize, remember to set that column's type to JSON or JSONB.  \n\nWhen `dataColumn` is not provided, the provider will work on all columns of the table instead.  \n\nBefore you can actually use the provider, you would have to run the `init` method.  \nFor example:  \n\n```js\nclass CustomClient extends AkairoClient {\n    /* ... */\n    login(token) {\n        return this.settings.init().then(() => super.login(token));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, the provider can be used like so:  \n\n```js\nclass CustomClient extends AkairoClient {\n    constructor() {\n        super({\n            prefix: message => {\n                if (message.guild) {\n                    // The third param is the default.\n                    return this.settings.get(message.guild.id, 'prefix', '!');\n                }\n\n                return '!';\n            }\n        });\n\n        /* ... */\n    }\n}\n```\n\nValues can be set with the `set` method:  \n\n```js\nconst { Command } = require('discord-akairo');\n\nclass PrefixCommand extends Command {\n    constructor() {\n        super('prefix', {\n            aliases: ['prefix'],\n            category: 'stuff',\n            args: [\n                {\n                    id: 'prefix',\n                    default: '!'\n                }\n            ],\n            channelRestriction: 'guild'\n        });\n    }\n\n    exec(message, args) {\n        // The third param is the default.\n        const oldPrefix = this.client.settings.get(message.guild.id, 'prefix', '!');\n\n        return this.client.settings.set(message.guild.id, 'prefix', args.prefix).then(() => {\n            return message.reply(`Prefix changed from ${oldPrefix} to ${args.prefix}`);\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = PrefixCommand;\n```\n","path":"docs/other/providers.md"},"clientutil":{"name":"ClientUtil","type":"md","content":"# ClientUtil\n\n### Finding Things\n\nClientUtil is a class
