This tutorial is for explaining how to handle edits.  
Here, we will make a command that can be ran when a message is edited.  

### Setup

There are some prerequisites to make a command run on an edit.  
First, the client should have `handleEdits` set to true.  

```js
// Client.
const client = new AkairoClient({
    handleEdits: true
});
```

To disable a command from being ran on edit, simply set `editable` to `false`.  

```js
module.exports = new Command('id', exec, {
    editable: false
});
```

### Actual Stuffs

And now, the command can be used when a message is edited.  
You can differentiate between a normal command use and an edited use with the `edited` param.  

```js
// Normal command:
function exec(message, args, edited)

// Regex command:
function exec(message, match, groups, edited)

// Condition command:
function exec(message, edited)
```

### Editing a Reply

Of course, replying from an edit continuously may be a little annoying.  
So, we use the `command` property on `message`, which contains this:  

```js
const { Command } = require('discord-akairo');

function exec(message, args, edited) {
    return message.command.send(args.content);
}

module.exports = new Command('say', exec, {
    aliases: ['say'],
    args: [
        {
            id: 'content',
            match: 'content'
        }
    ]
});
```

This `send` method will take care of edits and previous responses for you.  
Hopefully, it will provide a nice flow of messages.
