This tutorial is to show how arguments can be based on previous arguments.  
It also shows off the ways you can customize prompts and prompt messages.  

In this tutorial, a command will be made that:
1. Ask the user for a guild member.
2. Ask the user to narrow down to one member from the possibilties.
3. Ask the user for as many texts as they want.
4. Send that member the list of texts.

## Arguments Setup

First, let's setup the command and arguments.

```js
const { Command } = require('discord-akairo');

function exec(message, args) {
    // Fun stuff!
}

module.exports = new Command('spam', exec, {
    aliases: ['spam'],
    args: [
        {
            id: 'members'
        },
        {
            id: 'member'
        },
        {
            id: 'texts'
        }
    ]
});
```

The three arguments here are:
- The collection of members to narrow down, `members`.
- The narrowed-down member, `member`.
- The list of texts, `texts`.

The first argument is fairly simple.

```js
{
    id: 'members',
    type: 'members',
    prompt: {
        start: 'Who would you like to send to?',
        retry: 'Please input a valid member!'
    }
}
```

The second argument requires a bit of tinkering.  
A custom type function will be used.  

```js
{
    id: 'member',
    match: 'none',
    type: function type(word, message, args) {
        if (args.members.size === 1) return args.members.first();
        if (!word) return null;

        const members = this.client.util.resolveMembers(word, args.members);
        if (members.size === 1) return members.first();
        if (!members.size) return null;

        args.members = members;
        return null;
    },
    prompt: {
        start: (message, args) => {
            return [
                `${message.author}, multiple people were found, who would you like?`,
                args.members.map(members => members.user.longName).join(', ')
            ];
        },
        start: (message, args) => {
            return [
                `${message.author}, multiple people were found again, who would you like?`,
                args.members.map(members => members.user.longName).join(', ')
            ];
        }
    }
}
```

The `none` match matches nothing, since we only want to prompt, not match anything.  

In the type function, this happens:  
1. Check if the first arg has a size of one.
This means only one member was found.
So, we can resolve with that member and not worry about prompting.

2. Check if word is empty.
Since it is a none match, this will always be true the first time.
This causes it to skip to the prompt since `null` is returned.

3. Resolve members using input from the prompt.

4. Check if size is one, just like in step 1.

5. If no members were found, return `null` to prompt again with the collection from before.

6. Set the old `members` args to the newly resolved collection of members.

7. Return `null` to prompt and repeat the process.

And now, we can move on to the third a fairly simple argument.

```js
{
    id: 'texts',
    match: 'none',
    prompt: {
        start: 'What texts would you like to send?',
        infinite: true
    }
}
```

The `infinite` prompt option is used here.  
This means that the prompt will not end until the user says so.  
They can end the prompt by using the `stopWord`, which by default is "stop".  

We also match `none` here to make sure nothing from the user ends up in here accidentally.  
This argument will end up as an array of inputs.  

Now, we can do the rest of our command:  

```js
const { Command } = require('discord-akairo');

function exec(message, args) {
    // That was simple.
    return args.member.send(args.text.join('\n'));
}

module.exports = new Command('send', exec, {
    aliases: ['send'],
    args: [
        {
            id: 'members',
            type: 'members',
            prompt: {
                start: 'Who would you like to send to?',
                retry: 'Please input a valid member!'
            }
        },
        {
            id: 'member',
            match: 'none',
            type: function type(word, message, args) {
                if (args.members.size === 1) return args.members.first();
                if (!word) return null;

                const members = this.client.util.resolveMembers(word, args.members);
                if (members.size === 1) return members.first();
                if (!members.size) return null;

                args.members = members;
                return null;
            },
            prompt: {
                start: (message, args) => {
                    return [
                        `${message.author}, multiple people were found, who would you like?`,
                        args.members.map(members => members.user.longName).join(', ')
                    ];
                },
                start: (message, args) => {
                    return [
                        `${message.author}, multiple people were found again, who would you like?`,
                        args.members.map(members => members.user.longName).join(', ')
                    ];
                }
            }
        },
        {
            id: 'texts',
            match: 'none',
            prompt: {
                start: 'What texts would you like to send?',
                infinite: true
            }
        }
    ]
});
```

That is all for now!  
Enjoy making really fun and complex commands!
